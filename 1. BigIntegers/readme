# ðŸ”¢ Big Integer Class in C++     
This repository contains a powerful and flexible implementation of a Big Integer class in C++, using strings to represent arbitrarily large numbers. It's built to mimic native integer behavior through comprehensive operator overloading, making it intuitive and easy to use for large number calculations beyond the limits of built-in types.  

# ðŸš€ Features   
- Full support for arithmetic operations on large integers:
          +, -, *, /, %
- Support for compound assignments:
          +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
- Comparison operators:
          <, <=, >, >=, ==, !=
- Increment / Decrement:
- Prefix: ++a, --a
- Postfix: a++, a--
- Unary operators:
- Unary minus: -a
- Factorial: !a (custom overload for factorial computation)
- Robust input/output stream integration:
- Overloaded << and >> operators
- Handles negative numbers, leading zeros, and invalid input gracefully
- Designed for extensibility and readability

  
# ðŸ§  Why It Matters    
Standard data types in C++ (int, long long, etc.) canâ€™t store very large numbers. This class lets you go way beyond 64-bit limits, enabling precision-heavy tasks like cryptography, combinatorics (e.g., factorial of 100+), and competitive programming challenges.
